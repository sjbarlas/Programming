| P | Y | T | H | O | N |

# 1. len() - which gets the length (the number of characters) of a string!
parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print len(parrot)

# 2. lower() - gets rid of all the capitalization in your strings.
parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print parrot.lower()

# 3. upper() - makes a string completely upper case.

# 4. str() - method turns non-strings into strings!

# Dot Notation
"""
Methods that use dot notation only work with strings.
On the other hand, len() and str() can work on other data types. """
